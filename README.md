### Individual-taskINM707
##
In this notebook explored Deep Q learning but within the framework of Atari game employing the Rainbow DQN algorithm. It was chosen due to its specification of combing improvements in deep reinforcement learning. For this task, using RLlib to train an agent on an "Frostbbitedeterministic-v4" enviornment.
